## Next

- Continue adding provider-specific proxy compatibility tests and examples as remaining upstream contracts are verified
- Continue adding framework-oriented integration examples while keeping the core package dependency-light
- Expand the benchmark only with independently sourced labels, provenance, and manifest updates

## Explicitly not promised

- A universal "87% trustworthy" score
- A claim that one LLM judge solves hallucination
- Hidden chain-of-thought based judgments
- Universal OpenAI API compatibility
